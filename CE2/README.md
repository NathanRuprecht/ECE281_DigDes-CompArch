#Analysis
  The schematic of the circuit was given to us so the first thing I did was make a truth table that reflected the circuit.  This way, I could compare my results of the code to the truth table.  The waveform and console results for my structual code was the same as my behavioral code.  I promise I didn't cheat and use the same results.  This just proves that both ways work to get the same result.  Honestly, after using it, I prefer structual just because I can implement any number of components which I bet will be very useful down the road in this class.  I added the same self check code to every combination of the inputs so that the only reports that showed up on the console was when the output was 1.  My reason behind this is because there are only 4 instances where any of the outputs come out as true.  I compared my truth table with the results on the console to make sure the right output was getting a 1 for the specific inputs.  Having the console tell me which cases had a 1 was a lot easier and less error prone than me going through the waveform and matching my truth table to that.
