#Analysis
 After hours of work and struggling with the boolean algebra, it works!  Once the coding was done, I was sure to match every scenario of the waveform (shown below) with the truth table that was made for Lab1 (also shown below).  The schematics, K-Maps, and Boolean Algebra are all in pen and paper in my physical lab notebook.

##Analysis Part II
IT WORKS!!!!!!!  I just followed the steps and asked a few questions to try and understand what I was doing (except for just following the steps).  I got to the point where I was able to do a function check so I pulled up my truth table and went through each scenario to check if the right LED lights would come on depending on which switches were flipped on.  Everything worked on the first try!!! (really surprised by definitely not complaining).
