#Analysis
 Well its 1930 Monday night and I completely forgot to upload my files.... Woohoo.  I showed Dr. Neebel my ALU and it worked wonderfully.  The datapath, not so much.  I thought I had the code right but there was that one error I couldn't get rid of.  I thought I followed the instructions right since it seemed straight forward, but that one error wanted to stay.
