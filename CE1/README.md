#Analysis
  Based on the schematic (picture 1), the boolean algebra comes out to be (AB')+(BC).  That was used to get the truth table (picture 2).  After struggling with the code for who knows how long, the waveform (picture 3) matched up with the outputs of the truth table.
  The waveform is nice enough that it shows whether the input signals are 1 or 0, then shows the output signal as well so it was very easy to compare to my truth table.
